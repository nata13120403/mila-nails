        <h3>SOME TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND BEFORE VISITING THE SALON:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Please avoid wearing your best outfit. We try to practice cleanliness, however when working with our products sometime things happen. </li>
            <li>Bring a few pictures to show us what you are thinking about your nails.  This will help you and your master to be on the same page and can eliminate confusion and misunderstandings. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>RUNNING LATE? </h3>
        <p>Arriving 15 minutes past your appointment is, generally, too late because we work in 15-minute intervals at our salon. If you are running late, it causes the salon to run behind schedule for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p>Please give the salon a courtesy call if you are running late. Sometimes things happen that cannot be avoided. We understand. However,  depending on how late you are, rescheduling may be an option.</p>
        <p>If you are running 30 minutes late, it will be hard to fit your services into that time allotted for you and your stylist may not be able to squeeze you in.  It will be best to reschedule your appointment for a later date. A late start for one client  makes it worse for each client appointment following, and thatâ€™s unfair to clients who arrive on time.</p>
